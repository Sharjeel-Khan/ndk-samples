Order file demo
============================

Order files are text files containing symbols representing functions names. Linkers (lld) uses order files to layout functions in a specific order. These binaries with ordered symbols will reduce page faults and improve a program's launch time due to the efficient loading of symbols during a programâ€™s cold-start.

This demo was created based on the [PGO end-to-end demo](https://github.com/DanAlbert/ndk-samples/tree/pgo/pgo).

Files
--------
- app/src/main/cpp/orderfile.cpp: The source code for the orderfile library that is used by the Kotlin app. 
- app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt: The CMakeLists either sets the orderfile library as generating profiles or loading the orderfile.
- app/src/main/java/MainActivity.kt: The Kotlin app source code.

Profile Steps
---------------
1. For simplicity, we have setup the `CMakeLists.txt` and you just need make sure `set(GENERATE_PROFILES ON)` is not commented. You will notice it passes an optimization flag `-O1`. The mapping file is not generated and the profile instrumentation does not work without an optimization flag. 
2. Run the app on Android Studio. You can either run it on a physical or virtual device. You will see a "Hello World" on the screen.
3. To pull the data from the device, you'll need to move it from an app-writable directory to a shell readable directory for adb pull. This was take from the [PGO demo](https://github.com/DanAlbert/ndk-samples/tree/pgo/pgo). Unlike PGO, the output file is `demo.output.order` and we need to transfer the output into hexadecimal format.
```
adb shell "run-as com.example.orderfiledemo sh -c 'cat /data/user/0/com.example.orderfiledemo/cache/demo.output.order' | cat > /data/local/tmp/demo.output.order"
adb pull /data/local/tmp/demo.output.order .
od -h demo.output.order > demo.prof
```
4. Once you get both mapping file and profile file, you can use [this script](https://android.googlesource.com/toolchain/pgo-profiles/+/refs/heads/main/scripts/create_orderfile.py) to create the orderfile:
```
python3 create_orderfile.py --profile-file demo.prof --mapping-file mapping.txt --output app/src/main/cpp/demo.orderfile
```

Load Steps
---------------
1. For load, you need to uncomment `set(USE_PROFILE "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/demo.orderfile")` and make sure `set(GENERATE_PROFILES ON)` is commented.

2. If you want to validate the shared library's layout is different, you need to find `liborderfiledemo.so` and run `nm`
```
nm -n liborderfiledemo.so
```
